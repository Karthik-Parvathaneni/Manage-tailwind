# Manage Landing Page

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge - [Manage landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5/hub).

- I took this challenge to get familiar with the Tailwind CSS framework.
- This is the first project that I built using Tailwind.

# Usage

Install dependencies (Tailwind)

```
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the **input.css** during development. The output file is **Manage-Landing-Page/style.css**

```
npm run watch
```

To build once run...

```
npm run build
```

You can edit the scripts in package.json and the tailwind.config.js file to change input/output locations
